- **Funding Strategy**: Potential sources of funding, including grants, private investors, or partnerships with established cloud service providers.
- **Partnerships & Alliances**: Potential collaborators within the tech industry, civil society, academia, and government agencies.

### 5. Engage Stakeholders & Build Alliances
Form alliances with relevant stakeholders:
- **Government Officials**: Approach policymakers and legislators who could champion your cause.
- **Technology Organizations**: Partner with tech advocacy groups, think tanks, and industry bodies.
